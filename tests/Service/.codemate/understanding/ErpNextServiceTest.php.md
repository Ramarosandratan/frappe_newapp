# ErpNextServiceTest - High-Level Documentation

## Overview

The `ErpNextServiceTest` is a PHPUnit test case for testing the behavior of the `ErpNextService` class, which appears to facilitate interaction with an ERPNext backend (an ERP system) via HTTP API requests. The tests focus on the process of creating and retrieving "Employee" documents, as well as error handling for various HTTP status responses.

---

## Key Components & Dependencies

- **HttpClientInterface**: Symfony contract for making HTTP requests (mocked in tests).
- **LoggerInterface**: PSR-3 logger interface (mocked, not a test focus).
- **ResponseInterface**: Represents HTTP responses returned from the client (mocked).
- **ErpNextService**: Service under test, making HTTP calls to an ERPNext API.

## Setup

Each test sets up mocked instances of HTTP client, logger, and response objects. The service is instantiated with a test ERPNext URL, API key, and secret.

## Test Cases

### 1. testCreateDocTypeSuccessfully

- **Purpose**: Verifies successful creation of an employee.
- **Mock Behavior**: Simulates a 200 OK response with returned employee data.
- **Assertions**: Ensures the service returns the expected employee details after calling `addEmployee()`.

### 2. testCreateDocTypeHandlesConflict409

- **Purpose**: Tests handling of a 409 Conflict response (e.g., duplicate entries).
- **Mock Behavior**: Mocks a 409 status and duplicate entry error in the response content.
- **Assertions**: Expects a `RuntimeException` with message containing `"DuplicateEntryError"` when a duplicate is attempted.

### 3. testCreateDocTypeHandlesValidation417

- **Purpose**: Ensures that validation errors (HTTP 417) are handled correctly.
- **Mock Behavior**: Mocks a 417 status response with a validation error message.
- **Assertions**: Expects a `RuntimeException` with message containing `"ValidationError"` when required fields are missing.

### 4. testGetDocNotFound404

- **Purpose**: Checks behavior for non-existent employee retrieval (404 error).
- **Mock Behavior**: Simulates a 404 response with null data.
- **Assertions**: Ensures that requesting a non-existent employee returns an empty result.

## Exception Handling

- The tests confirm that `ErpNextService` throws appropriate exceptions (typically `RuntimeException`) for error conditions, and includes meaningful exception messages to reflect the API's error responses.

## Conclusion

This test suite verifies that `ErpNextService`:
- Correctly processes successful responses from the ERPNext API,
- Handles and surfaces API error responses (conflicts and validation errors) as exceptions,
- Deals gracefully with "not found" cases,
- Uses dependency injection and mocks for isolation in unit tests.

The focus is on employee document creation and retrieval, specifically the robustness of error handling in the face of different HTTP response codes.
