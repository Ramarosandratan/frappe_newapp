# Security Vulnerability Report

## Introduction

This report examines the provided Webpack Encore configuration file for **security vulnerabilities**. All findings relate specifically to the exposed attack surfaces or insecure configurations in the context of asset building for web application deployment.

---

## 1. Public Path Exposure

```js
.setPublicPath('/build')
```
- **Risk:** If your web server is not configured to serve files from `public/build` securely, there is a potential for unintended disclosure of source maps or build artifacts.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure your web server restricts access to sensitive files and folders within `public/build`. Limit access to only necessary assets.

---

## 2. Source Map Exposure in Production

```js
.enableSourceMaps(!Encore.isProduction())
```
- **Risk:** This setting correctly disables source map generation in production. Publishing source maps to public servers in production is dangerous because it can expose your source code, revealing business logic, credentials, or other sensitive information.
- **Mitigation:** **No vulnerability detected** in the current configuration, but regularly audit your build artifacts to ensure source maps are not included in production.

---

## 3. Output Cleanup Before Build

```js
.cleanupOutputBeforeBuild()
```
- **Risk:** No direct vulnerability, but if output cleanup is misconfigured or used with a path outside the intended project (e.g., outside `public/build`), could potentially delete unintended files. This is not the case here, but remains a general caution.
- **Recommendation:** Ensure only the intended directory is targeted and **never** allow dynamic path components from user input.

---

## 4. Dependency and Version Risks

- **Babel and Core-js:**
    ```js
    config.corejs = '3.23';
    ```
    - **Risk:** Outdated or vulnerable versions of Babel or `core-js` introduce risks (prototype pollution, etc.). It's not a direct vulnerability in this `webpack.config.js`, but ensure all dependencies are regularly audited (e.g., using `npm audit`/`yarn audit`).

---

## 5. Entry Points and Assets

- **Risk:** The configuration does not reference or include user input for file paths. If you dynamically build entry points from user input or untrusted sources, this can introduce LFI (Local File Inclusion) or RFI (Remote File Inclusion) vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigation:** No vulnerability as currently written, but avoid dynamically constructing entry points from unvalidated sources.

---

## 6. Notifications

```js
.enableBuildNotifications()
```
- **Risk:** No direct risk, but notifications on build systems should be monitored for leakages in CI/CD pipelines (for example, leaking environment variables in notifications).

---

## 7. Stimulus Bridge Controllers

```js
.enableStimulusBridge('./assets/controllers.json')
```
- **Risk:** If `controllers.json` or any dynamically loaded controllers contain sensitive logic, validate and sanitize file contents.
- **Recommendation:** Restrict access to `assets` directory and audit included controllers.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                 | Present? | Comment                                             |
|-------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Source Maps in Production     |   No     | Correctly disabled for production                   |
| Output Path Misconfiguration  |   No     | Only risks if path dynamically generated            |
| Outdated Dependencies         | **?**    | Audit dependencies regularly                        |
| Dynamic Entry Points          |   No     | Static and safe in this config                      |
| Sensitive Asset Exposure      | **?**    | Ensure `public/build` files are safe for exposure   |
| Arbitrary File Deletion       |   No     | Path appears static                                 |

## Recommendations

1. **Maintain Dependency Hygiene:** Frequently audit NPM/Yarn dependencies for vulnerabilities.
2. **Static Paths Only:** Do not allow user input in build configuration paths or file references.
3. **Build Artifact Review:** Regularly review what files are published in `public/build`, especially when deploying.
4. **Server Configuration:** Ensure the web server does not allow directory listing and restricts source maps and other sensitive artifacts.

---

## Conclusion

**No critical security vulnerabilities** were observed in the provided Webpack Encore configuration. Most risks are environmental or relate to downstream dependencies or server configuration, not directly exposed by this script. Nonetheless, continuous monitoring, secure server configuration, and dependency management remain essential best practices.
