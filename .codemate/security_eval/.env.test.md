# Security Vulnerability Report

## Code Reviewed

```python
# define your env variables for the test env here
KERNEL_CLASS='App\Kernel'
APP_SECRET='$ecretf0rt3st'
```

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Hardcoded Secret Key (`APP_SECRET`)

#### Description
The application secret (`APP_SECRET`) is hardcoded directly into the source file. This practice exposes sensitive information to anyone with access to the source code repository and increases the risk of accidental leaks via code sharing, public repositories, or improper access controls.

#### Potential Impact
- Unauthorized users could gain access to the application's cryptographic secrets.
- It may allow adversaries to bypass security mechanisms, forge session tokens, or exploit cryptographic operations relying on the secret.
- If propagated to production inadvertently, it may severely compromise application security.

#### Recommendation
- **Do not hardcode secrets in source files.** Use environment variables or secured secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Exclude files containing secrets from version control and remove any previously committed secrets.
- Regularly rotate secrets in the event of potential leaks.

## Additional Notes

- The variable `KERNEL_CLASS` does not appear to be a security-sensitive value, based on its name and typical usage.
- If this file is used for testing only, ensure test secrets are distinct from production secrets and are never reused in deployment.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability | Risk Level | Recommendation                   |
| ------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| Hardcoded secret key (`APP_SECRET`) | High       | Use external secret management and environment variables |

---

**Immediate action**: Remove any sensitive secrets from source files and scan your codebase for potential exposures. Ensure secrets are securely injected at runtime.
