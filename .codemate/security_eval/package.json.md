# Security Vulnerability Analysis Report

**Target File:** `package.json`  
**Scope:** Review for Security Vulnerabilities Only  
**Date:** 2024-06

---

## Overview

The provided code is a typical `package.json` configuration for a JavaScript/Node.js project using Symfony Encore and Stimulus. It specifies development dependencies and npm scripts for building and developing a front-end application.

This report identifies only security vulnerabilities and risks inherent in the configuration or in the referenced package versions.

---

## Identified Security Issues

### 1. **Use of Outdated Dependency Versions**

#### @symfony/webpack-encore (^1.7.0)
- **Risk:** As of June 2024, the latest version of `@symfony/webpack-encore` is much higher than 1.7.0. Using older versions may expose your project to known vulnerabilities.
- **Action:** Update to the latest version to get security patches.

#### core-js (^3.0.0)
- **Risk:** `core-js` has historically suffered from supply-chain attacks and is a frequent target for malicious actors due to its popularity. Notably, in March 2024, malicious versions of `core-js` were briefly published. Using outdated core-js increases risk.
- **Action:** Regularly update `core-js` and lock its version to minimize accidental upgrades to malicious releases. Ensure integrity checks are in place.

#### regenerator-runtime (^0.13.2)
- **Risk:** Outdated or unmaintained dependencies can result in exposure to unpatched vulnerabilities. Always use the latest secure version.

#### webpack-notifier (^1.6.0)
- **Risk:** This commonly triggers "prototype pollution" or other vulnerabilities if not kept up-to-date.

#### stimulus (^2.0.0) & @symfony/stimulus-bridge (^3.0.0)
- **Risk:** Ensure these packages are up-to-date. Older versions may not have the latest security fixes, especially as supply-chain attacks become more frequent.

### 2. **No Dependency Auditing Configured**

- **Risk:** There’s no automation in place for vulnerability scanning (e.g., `audit` scripts). This increases the risk of unnoticed vulnerable dependencies.
- **Action:** Integrate tools such as `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or `snyk` into your workflow.

### 3. **No Integrity or Lock File Enforcement**

- **Risk:** No mention of a `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`. Without a lock file, different installs may resolve to different versions, some of which may be vulnerable or malicious.
- **Action:** Always commit a lock file to source control, and consider using npm/yarn integrity checks.

### 4. **Potential Exposure of Development Dependencies**

- **Risk:** If server-side code or build tools are ever exposed to untrusted input, outdated devDependencies could be leveraged in an attack (e.g., via local development, CI/CD, or if scripts are reused on the server).
- **Action:** Restrict the use of development dependencies outside of controlled environments.

## Recommendations

1. **Update Dependencies Regularly.**
    - Check for the latest versions and update as soon as possible.
    - Use tools like `npm-check-updates` and `npm audit fix`.

2. **Audit Dependencies Automatically.**
    - Integrate `npm audit` or `yarn audit` into CI/CD pipelines.
    - Consider third-party monitoring (ex: Snyk).

3. **Lock Dependencies.**
    - Always commit your lock file to version control.
    - Set up policies to ensure dependencies are only installed from lock files.

4. **Monitor for Compromised Packages.**
    - Keep abreast of supply-chain attacks, especially with highly popular packages like `core-js`.

5. **Limit DevDependency Usage to Development.**
    - Ensure development tools are never bundled into production deployments.

## Conclusion

**Severity: Moderate**  
Your `package.json` references several dependencies at outdated versions, creating exposure to potential vulnerabilities — especially in high-risk packages (`core-js`, `webpack-notifier`, etc.). No specific vulnerabilities are indicated in the file itself, but the risk is from inherited/transitive vulnerabilities from those packages.

**Immediate Steps:**
- Update all dependencies to their latest secure versions.
- Add a lock file.
- Implement dependency auditing and integrity checking.
