# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

The provided code is a docker-compose snippet defining services for a `database` (with port 5432) and a `mailer` based on the `axllent/mailpit` image (with ports 1025 and 8025). The `mailer` service includes environment variables affecting authentication settings.

This report identifies and explains any security vulnerabilities present in the configuration.

## Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insecure Mailpit SMTP Authentication

**Configuration:**
```yaml
environment:
  MP_SMTP_AUTH_ACCEPT_ANY: 1
  MP_SMTP_AUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE: 1
```

**Description:**

- **MP_SMTP_AUTH_ACCEPT_ANY: 1**
  - This setting allows Mailpit to accept any SMTP authentication credentials, effectively disabling authentication checks.
- **MP_SMTP_AUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE: 1**
  - This setting allows the use of insecure SMTP authentication mechanisms, rather than requiring secure methods (such as TLS).

**Risks:**

- **Unauthorized Access**: Anyone who can reach the mailer service's SMTP port (1025) can relay emails through the service without credentials. This opens the service to abuse as an open mail relay by attackers.
- **Spam and Reputation**: The mailer can be exploited to send spam or phishing emails, placing your infrastructure at risk of blacklisting.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: By allowing insecure authentication mechanisms, credentials may be sent in plain text, making them susceptible to interception.

**Recommendation:**

- Only set these insecure environment variables in isolated local development environments that are never exposed to public or production networks.
- For production and shared environments, **remove both `MP_SMTP_AUTH_ACCEPT_ANY` and `MP_SMTP_AUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE`** or set their values to `0` to enforce proper authentication and secure transport.

### 2. Exposed Database Port

**Configuration:**
```yaml
database:
  ports:
    - "5432"
```

**Description:**

- Port 5432 is the default port for PostgreSQLâ€”making this service accessible on this port.

**Risks:**

- **Unrestricted Network Access**: If the docker-compose environment is deployed without network restrictions, PostgreSQL is accessible to any host that can connect to this port.
- **Brute Force/Unauthorized Access**: Attackers may attempt to brute-force the database or exploit known vulnerabilities if the port is publicly accessible.

**Recommendation:**

- **Bind ports to localhost**: Use `"127.0.0.1:5432:5432"` instead of `"5432"` to limit access to the host machine.
- **Network segmentation**: Use Docker networks and avoid port exposure unless necessary. Connect services via internal networking.
- **Strong Credentials**: Ensure the database is protected with strong usernames and passwords.
- **Firewall**: Use firewalls or security groups to restrict access on port 5432.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                                | Severity | Affected Service | Recommendation                                               |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insecure SMTP authentication (Mailpit)        | High     | mailer           | Remove `MP_SMTP_AUTH_ACCEPT_ANY` and `MP_SMTP_AUTH_ALLOW_INSECURE` or set to 0 in production. Enforce secure authentication. |
| Exposed PostgreSQL port                       | Medium   | database         | Bind to localhost, use secure credentials, restrict with firewalls. |

## General Recommendations

- Never expose development or test services with insecure authentication or unprotected ports to public or shared networks.
- Review and harden docker-compose configurations before deploying to production or any non-local environment.
