# SECURITY VULNERABILITY REPORT

## Scanned Code

The provided code is a Docker Compose snippet configuring a Postgres database service.

---

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Hardcoded Default Credentials**

- **POSTGRES_PASSWORD:**  
  The environment variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is set to `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-!ChangeMe!}`.
  - **Issue:** If no environment variable is provided during deployment, the database password defaults to `!ChangeMe!`, a weak and commonly known default password.
  - **Risk:** Attackers who gain access to the environment or source code can easily guess or brute-force the default password, leading to unauthorized access to the database.
  - **Recommendation:** Enforce strong, unique passwords in production. Never commit default or placeholder passwords to version control.

### 2. **Exposure of Sensitive Configuration via Source Control**

- **Sensitive Information in Code:**  
  Although environment variables are used, default values for usernames and passwords are still present in the codebase.
  - **Issue:** If the code is shared or made public, attackers can see these default values.
  - **Risk:** Allows reconnaissance and increases attack surface if the defaults are used in real deployments.
  - **Recommendation:** Do not provide default credentials in code committed to source control. Use secure secrets management solutions and environment variable configuration outside the code repo.

### 3. **Potential Volume Misconfiguration and Data Exposure**

- **Commented-out Bind Mount:**  
  The comment suggests mounting host directories, e.g., `./docker/db/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data:rw`.
  - **Issue:** If enabled, this could lead to sensitive database files being present on developer machines or servers, possibly without proper access controls.
  - **Risk:** Increases risk of data leakage or unauthorized access to raw database files, especially if permissions are not restrictive.
  - **Recommendation:** Ensure data volumes are secured, directories are access-controlled, and never shared unintentionally, especially in production.

### 4. **Environment Variable Leakage**

- **Potential for Variable Exposure:**  
  Docker Compose files can be inadvertently logged or exposed to version control.
  - **Risk:** If environment variables (especially secrets like `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`) are exposed, credentials can be compromised.
  - **Recommendation:** Use `.env` files (excluded from version control), Docker secrets, or external secrets managers for all sensitive environment variables.

## Best Practices and Mitigation

- **Always use strong, unique passwords** for all default services, and never commit example or development credentials as defaults in production settings.
- **Store sensitive secrets out of source control** and inject them at runtime through secure infrastructure.
- **Restrict access** to persistent volumes containing database data, and ensure appropriate permissions are set on host directories if used.
- **Review Docker and Docker Compose file permissions,** only share the absolute minimum necessary with collaborators.
- **Implement database-level access controls** (such as restricting allowed IPs and using TLS where possible).

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                | Risk Level | Exposure          | Recommendation                                  |
|------------------------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded default password   | High       | Credentials leak  | Use secure secrets management, never default    |
| Sensitive config in repo     | Medium     | Information leak  | Move secrets to external management             |
| Data volume host bind        | Medium     | Data leak         | Properly secure and limit volume access         |
| Env var leakage              | Medium     | Secrets exposure  | Keep .env files out of version control          |

**In summary:** Immediate attention should be given to credential management and secrets exposure in both development and production deployments to mitigate significant security risks.
