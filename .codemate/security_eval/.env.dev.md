# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

The reviewed code snippet contains a configuration setting derived from a `.env` or configuration file for a Symfony application. The only relevant line for analysis is:

```
APP_SECRET=843e90b1c03d66df6535b05a32c171fa
```

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Exposure of Sensitive Secret Key in Source Code

- **Vulnerability**: The `APP_SECRET` value, which is a sensitive cryptographic secret, is exposed in plain text. If this file is tracked in version control, shared, or leaked, attackers could gain access to the application's secret value.
- **Impact**: An attacker with knowledge of `APP_SECRET` can:
    - Tamper with cookies, session tokens, or CSRF tokens.
    - Use brute-force or replay attacks on cryptographic functions.
    - Impersonate users or gain unauthorized access to protected resources.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Store secrets in environment variables at the system or application server level, outside of version-controlled files.
    - Add `.env` and other configuration files containing secrets to `.gitignore`.
    - Consider rotating the secret and updating dependent cryptographic data if exposure is suspected.

### 2. Hardcoded (Predictable) Secret Value

- **Vulnerability**: The `APP_SECRET` appears to be statically set. If this value was generated insecurely or is otherwise predictable, it may be susceptible to guessing or brute-force attacks.
- **Impact**: Predictable secrets weaken the strength of cryptography; attackers may be able to derive or guess the secret, negating security mechanisms dependent on its secrecy.
- **Mitigation**:
    - Generate application secrets using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
    - Ensure the secret is long and complex enough to resist brute-force attacks.

## Recommendations

- **Do not commit secrets to version control**: Exclude files with secrets from your repository and manage secrets securely.
- **Rotate secrets if exposure occurs**: Treat any secret committed to a repository or exposed as compromised.
- **Use a secret management tool or service**: Consider using environment management systems or secret vaults to inject secrets at runtime.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                           | Risk Level | Mitigation                          |
|------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Secret exposed in source code            | High       | Store outside version control       |
| Potential for weak or predictable secret | High       | Use secure random secret generation |
