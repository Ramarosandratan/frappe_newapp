This configuration file contains an environment variable used by the Symfony Framework Bundle for a web application. The key `APP_SECRET` holds a unique, secret value required by Symfony for cryptographic operations, such as generating secure tokens, encrypting/decrypting data, and validating the integrity of cookies or CSRF tokens. This value should be kept confidential and not shared publicly, as its compromise can lead to security vulnerabilities within the application.
