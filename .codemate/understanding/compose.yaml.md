High-Level Documentation

This code is a Docker Compose YAML configuration that defines services and volumes for a PostgreSQL database, intended for integration with projects using Doctrine (a popular ORM for PHP/Symfony applications). Here’s a high-level overview:

**Purpose**
- Sets up a PostgreSQL database container with customizable environment variables and persistent storage.
- Suitable for local development and may serve as a starting point for production (with necessary security adjustments).

**Main Components**

1. **Services**
   - **database**:  
     - Uses the official PostgreSQL image (defaulting to version 16-alpine, but overridable via the POSTGRES_VERSION environment variable).
     - Configures the database name, user, and password using environment variables (with defaults provided).  
     - Includes a healthcheck to ensure the database is ready to accept connections before dependent services start.
     - The database data persists in a Docker-managed volume (`database_data`), ensuring data is not lost when the container stops/restarts.
     - Provides a commented example for using a local directory for data storage, offering an alternative for more control or disaster recovery.
       
2. **Volumes**
   - **database_data**:  
     - Defines a persistent volume for storing PostgreSQL data outside the lifecycle of the container.
     - Helps prevent accidental data loss.

**Customization & Security**
- Environment variables can be easily changed, including credentials—make sure to change the default password in production.
- Data storage location can be customized to use either Docker volumes or local directories.
- The configuration is annotated for clarity, indicating its association with the Doctrine bundle.

**Intended Usage**
- Plug-and-play database backend for applications that use Doctrine with Docker.
- Facilitates development, testing, and can be adapted for production with enhanced hardening.
