# High-Level Documentation

## Purpose
This code is a `package.json` file, which serves as the configuration file for managing Node.js dependencies and scripts in a JavaScript/Symfony-based web development project.

## Key Functions

- **Dependency Management:**  
  Specifies the libraries and tools needed for frontend development, especially for projects using [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html).

- **Development and Build Scripts:**  
  Defines scripts to:
  - Run a development server (`dev`)
  - Watch for file changes during development (`watch`)
  - Build production-ready frontend assets (`build`)

## Main Libraries/Tools Used

- **@symfony/webpack-encore:**  
  Provides a simple interface for compiling and managing frontend assets with Webpack.

- **@symfony/stimulus-bridge** and **stimulus:**  
  Integrate [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) (a JavaScript framework) with Symfony.

- **core-js** and **regenerator-runtime:**  
  Allow usage of modern JavaScript features and polyfilling for older browser support.

- **webpack-notifier:**  
  Provides desktop notifications for build events.

## Usage Flow

1. **Development:**  
   Run `npm run dev` to start the asset compilation in development mode, or `npm run watch` to automatically recompile on file changes.

2. **Production Build:**  
   Run `npm run build` for optimized, production-ready assets.

## Target Audience

Primarily for developers working on Symfony applications who need a structured way to manage and compile JavaScript and CSS assets using modern JavaScript tooling.
