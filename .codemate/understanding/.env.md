# High-Level Documentation

## Overview

This file is a configuration template for a Symfony application. Its purpose is to define default environment variables that control core aspects of the application behavior across different environments (development, production, etc.). It supports layered overrides and prioritizes real environment variables over those in files.

---

## Loading and Override Order

- `.env`: Base configuration for environment variables.
- `.env.local`: Local (uncommitted) overrides for developers.
- `.env.$APP_ENV`: Environment-specific configuration (e.g., `.env.dev`, `.env.prod`).
- `.env.$APP_ENV.local`: Local overrides for a specific environment.
- **Priority**: System environment variables > .env files (the latter loaded in order above).

**Note:** Secrets and sensitive production settings should never be committed to these files.

---

## Main Sections

1. **Symfony Framework Bundle**
   - `APP_ENV`: Application environment (`dev` by default).
   - `APP_SECRET`: Secret value for security mechanisms (should be set).

2. **Doctrine Database Configuration**
   - `DATABASE_URL`: DSN string to configure the database connection (PostgreSQL example active, templates for SQLite/MySQL provided).
   - Commented configurations help with different database platforms and server versions.

3. **Messenger Bundle**
   - `MESSENGER_TRANSPORT_DSN`: Defines the transport layer for message handling (default: Doctrine transport; AMQP and Redis examples commented).

4. **Mailer Bundle**
   - `MAILER_DSN`: Transport protocol for sending emails (set to null for disabling emails by default).

5. **Custom (ERPNext) Integration**
   - `API_BASE`: Base URL for the ERPNext instance.
   - `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`: Credentials for ERPNext API access (example values shown).

## Best Practices

- Do not store or commit production secrets in this file.
- Use environment variables for configuration, especially for infrastructure-related settings.
- For production, compile the env files using `composer dump-env`.

**Summary:**  
This file is the central place to configure the applicationâ€™s environment variables in a flexible and layered way, covering core framework settings, database connection, message handling, email delivery, and a custom integration. It is intended for local and development use, and its sensitive data should *never* be committed for production environments.
