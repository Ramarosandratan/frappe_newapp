# High-Level Documentation for Provided Code (composer.json)

This file defines the high-level configuration and dependencies for a PHP project using Composer, with a focus on Symfony 7.3 and Doctrine. Below is an overview of its key aspects:

---

## 1. **Project Type and Requirements**
- **Type:** Project
- **PHP Version:** Requires PHP 8.2 or later
- **Stability:** Only stable packages (minimum-stability: stable)
- **License:** Proprietary (closed source)

---

## 2. **Core Dependencies**
The project is heavily based on Symfony 7.3 components and bundles, likely indicating a modern web application. Major groups of dependencies include:
- **Symfony Components:** Comprehensive inclusion (Framework, Console, Form, Security, Validator, Twig, etc.).
- **Doctrine:** Database abstraction and ORM (DBAL, ORM, Migrations).
- **PDF/Report Generation & CSV:** KNP Snappy Bundle for PDFs and League\CSV for CSV handling.
- **Reflection/Parsing:** PHPDocumentor and PHPStan PHPDoc parser.
- **Math Parsing:** Mossadal Math Parser.
- **Other Symfony UX Bundles:** For modern front-end integrations (e.g., ChartJS, Turbo).
- **Mailer & Notifier:** For sending emails and notifications.

---

## 3. **Autoloading**
- **Application Code:** Mapped under `App\` namespace from `src/`.
- **Test Code:** Mapped under `App\Tests\` from `tests/`.

---

## 4. **Development Tools**
- **Testing:** PHPUnit
- **Other Bundles:** Web Profiler, Debug, Maker, and tools for browser automation and profiling.
- **Symfony Flex:** For recipe-based Symfony integration.

---

## 5. **Composer Features & Customization**
- **Scripts:** Automates tasks like cache clearing and asset installation on install/update.
- **Polyfills:** Replaces legacy PHP features for maximum compatibility.
- **Conflict Management:** Explicitly conflicts with `symfony/symfony` (the all-in-one package), to ensure use of individual components.
- **Allow Plugins:** Whitelists major composer and Symfony plugins for execution.

---

## 6. **Symfony Special Configuration**
- Forces use of Symfony 7.3.*, with contributions limited (no contrib recipes), ensuring only officially supported functionality.

---

## 7. **Summary**
This configuration sets up a modern, robust Symfony web application with:
- Strong focus on modular architecture using Symfony components.
- Advanced data handling (Doctrine, CSV, PDF generation).
- Tools for modern frontend through Symfony UX bundles.
- Automated scripts for routine maintenance tasks.
- Strict compatibility and stability guarantees.

---

**Intended Audience:**  
Developers setting up or maintaining a complex, enterprise-grade Symfony web application that relies on Symfony 7.3, advanced ORM/database handling, document generation, and rich front-end tools.
