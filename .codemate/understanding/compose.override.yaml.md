High-Level Documentation

This configuration defines containerized service setups for use in a development environment (e.g., with Docker Compose), focusing on database and mail services integrated into a Symfony application.

1. Database Service

- The service named database is set up to expose port 5432.
- This is intended for use with Doctrine ORM, suggesting a PostgreSQL database is expected (though the image and further config are not shown here).
- This enables the Symfony app to communicate with the database on the standard PostgreSQL port.

2. Mailer Service

- The mailer service uses the Mailpit container image (axllent/mailpit) as a development SMTP server for email testing.
- Two ports are exposed:
  - 1025: SMTP service port for receiving emails.
  - 8025: Web interface for viewing sent emails in the browser.
- Environment variables enable broad (insecure) authentication, making it simple for any client (such as Symfony’s mailer) to connect and send test emails without security restrictions.

3. Integration Context

- These service definitions are tagged for use with Symfony’s doctrine/doctrine-bundle (for the database) and symfony/mailer (for email testing).
- They are generally intended for local development setups to simplify integration and testing, avoiding the need for real production services.
