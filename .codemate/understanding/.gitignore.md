High-Level Documentation

This code snippet is a .gitignore configuration file commonly used in Symfony PHP projects. It is used to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by version control (typically Git). The rules are grouped by the corresponding Symfony or PHP package. Here's a high-level breakdown:

1. symfony/framework-bundle
   - Ignores environment-specific configuration files and secrets that often contain sensitive information, cache/var directories, vendor dependencies, and public bundle assets.

2. phpunit/phpunit
   - Ignores PHPUnitâ€™s configuration and cache files generated during testing.

3. symfony/asset-mapper
   - Ignores directories where built or vendor frontend assets are stored.

Overall, the file ensures that local configuration, cache, secrets, and build artifacts are excluded from version control, keeping the repository clean and secure.
