# High-Level Documentation

This code snippet defines environment variables for a test environment in a PHP application, likely a Symfony project. The variables are:

- `KERNEL_CLASS`: Specifies the fully qualified class name of the application's kernel, which is responsible for bootstrapping the application.
- `APP_SECRET`: Sets a secret key used for cryptographic operations such as generating tokens or hashing data within the application.

These variables configure the application for use in a testing context.
