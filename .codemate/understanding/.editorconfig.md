# High-Level Documentation for the Provided `.editorconfig` File

This `.editorconfig` file is used to standardize coding style and formatting settings across different editors and IDEs for a project. The settings defined apply to files in this directory and its subdirectories. Here is an overview of the configuration:

## Global Settings (`[*]`)
- **Character Set:** Files use UTF-8 encoding.
- **Line Endings:** Line endings are set to LF (Unix-style).
- **Indentation:** Indentation uses 4 spaces.
- **Final Newline:** A newline is inserted automatically at the end of every file.
- **Trailing Whitespace:** All trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed.

## Overrides for YAML Compose Files (`{compose.yaml,compose.*.yaml}`)
- **Indentation:** For Docker Compose YAML files, indentation is set to 2 spaces instead of the global 4.

## Overrides for Markdown Files (`*.md`)
- **Trailing Whitespace:** Trimming of trailing whitespace is disabled for Markdown files, to preserve intentional spaces (e.g., for line breaks).

## General Purpose
This configuration promotes consistent formatting among contributors, reduces style-related merge conflicts, and can be respected by most major editors and IDEs that support EditorConfig.
