# Code Review Report

**File Type:** `package.json`  
**Review Scope:** Industry standards for software development, unoptimized implementations, errors.

## 1. Error: Invalid Build Script

**Issue:**  
The `"build": "encore production --progress"` script is likely incorrect as `encore production` is not a valid command. Standard usage for Webpack Encore is `encore production` replaced by `encore production` (deprecated) or `encore` or `encore production` replaced by `encore production` with proper flags. The typical command should be `encore production` (for full build) or `encore prod`.

**Suggested Correction:**
```json
"build": "encore production --progress"
```
**Update to:**
```pseudo
"build": "encore production"
```
or (depending on the version, most commonly):
```pseudo
"build": "encore production"
```
Check the version of Webpack Encore being used and refer to current [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/simple-example.html#building-for-production).

---

## 2. Optimization: Missing `dependencies` Field

**Issue:**  
The file only lists `devDependencies` and omits direct production `dependencies`. While it may be intentional, often, core dependencies are missing, which could lead to issues in production as only `devDependencies` will be installed in certain environments.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
"dependencies": {
  // Place your production dependencies here if any are required during runtime
}
```

---

## 3. Industry Standard: Node Version Specification

**Issue:**  
It is standard to specify engines (Node and npm version) to ensure consistency across different environments.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
"engines": {
  "node": ">=14.0.0",
  "npm": ">=6.0.0"
}
```
*(Adjust versions as required)*

---

## 4. Unnecessary `private` Key

**Issue:**  
While `"private": true` is used to prevent accidental publication of a package, validate if this is truly desired. It's fine for applications, but not always appropriate for libraries. If this is an application, keep it; otherwise, assess project intent.

**Suggested Correction:**  
_No change if this is an application; otherwise, remove `"private": true` if publishing as a package/library._

---

## 5. Consistent Script Naming

**Issue:**  
Industry standards recommend script names like `"start"` for development, and `"build"` for production builds.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
"start": "encore dev"
```
(Optionally, keep `"dev"` and `"start"` for better compatibility with popular tools.)

---

## 6. Outdated Dependency Versions

**Issue:**  
Check if dependencies are at their latest supported versions (especially `@symfony/webpack-encore`). Outdated dependencies may result in security vulnerabilities or incompatibility. Run `npm outdated` and upgrade where possible.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
// Update versions after checking compatibility
"@symfony/webpack-encore": "^4.0.0"  // example, if safe to upgrade
```

---

## 7. Recommend Using `prepare` Script for Post-Install Actions

**Issue:**  
If post-install actions (like building assets) are required, use the `prepare` or `postinstall` scripts.

**Suggested Correction:**
```pseudo
"prepare": "npm run build"
```

## Final Notes

- Validate the usage of `encore` commands with your version.
- Regularly update all dependencies for security and feature set.
- Specify Node.js and npm versions to avoid "works on my machine" issues.
- Add missing scripts for conventional workflows.
