# Code Review Report

**Code under Review:**

```yaml
framework:
    router:
        # Configure how to generate URLs in non-HTTP contexts, such as CLI commands.
        # See https://symfony.com/doc/current/routing.html#generating-urls-in-commands
        #default_uri: http://localhost

when@prod:
    framework:
        router:
            strict_requirements: null
```

---

## 1. **Commented-Out Configuration**

- **Observation:**  
  The default_uri configuration line is commented out. This can lead to issues when your application generates URLs in non-HTTP contexts (like CLI commands or background jobs), potentially causing bugs in a production environment.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Uncomment and appropriately configure `default_uri` to ensure URL generation works as expected in all environments.

- **Suggested Pseudocode:**
  ```
  default_uri: "https://your-production-domain.com"
  ```

---

## 2. **Improper strict_requirements Setting**

- **Observation:**  
  Setting `strict_requirements: null` is ambiguous and can lead to unexpected routing behavior. According to Symfony standards, this should be a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

- **Recommendation:**  
  Set `strict_requirements` to a clear boolean value based on your needs. In production, it's advisable to have it as `true` to avoid invalid routes being generated.

- **Suggested Pseudocode:**
  ```
  strict_requirements: true
  ```

---

## 3. **Environment Specificity and Maintainability**

- **Observation:**  
  The configuration does not separate shared and environment-specific settings optimally, which could undermine maintainability as the project grows.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Place only overrides under `when@prod`, and move shared/base settings into the root configuration to enhance clarity.

- **Suggested Pseudocode:**
  ```
  # Base configuration
  framework:
      router:
          default_uri: "https://your-production-domain.com"
          # other shared settings

  # Override for production environment
  when@prod:
      framework:
          router:
              strict_requirements: true
  ```

---

## 4. **Missing Explicit Type Declaration**

- **Observation:**  
  YAML is sensitive to type ambiguity, and it is always best practice to make values explicit, especially for booleans.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Use explicit boolean notation (`true`, `false`, not `null` or numeric).

- **Suggested Pseudocode:**
  ```
  strict_requirements: true  # NOT null
  ```

| Issue                                   | Line(s)       | Severity | Recommendation                              |
|------------------------------------------|---------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Commented-out `default_uri` value        | Line 5        | Medium   | Set and uncomment with actual URL value      |
| `strict_requirements: null` ambiguous    | Line 11       | High     | Use `true` or `false` instead of `null`      |
| Base/env duplication risk                | All           | Info     | Separate shared vs. prod-only settings       |
| Boolean type ambiguity                   | Line 11       | High     | Use explicit boolean value                   |

# **General Recommendations**

- Double-check Symfony configuration references for all options used.
- Always use explicit values for improved clarity and reliability.
- Make sure environment-specific configurations override only where necessary.
