# Security Vulnerability Report

## Analyzed Code

```yaml
framework:
    asset_mapper:
        # The paths to make available to the asset mapper.
        paths:
            - assets/
        missing_import_mode: strict

when@prod:
    framework:
        asset_mapper:
            missing_import_mode: warn
```

## Security Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. Asset Path Exposure

**Details:**  
The configuration exposes the entire `assets/` directory to the asset mapper. If this directory contains sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, credentials, private data), they may be inadvertently exposed over the web depending on how asset_mapper is implemented and how routing is configured in the broader application.

**Risk:**  
Potential information disclosure of sensitive files.

**Recommendation:**  
- Restrict the contents of the `assets/` directory to only public, non-sensitive files.
- Consider implementing server-side filtering or validation to ensure only intended files are published.

---

### 2. Change in Import Behavior in Production

**Details:**  
In the production environment (`when@prod`), `missing_import_mode` is set to `warn` instead of `strict`. This may allow the application to run even when some asset imports fail or are missing. Attackers could exploit missing or misconfigured imports to perform attacks such as:
- Substituting missing resources with malicious files if the configuration or serving logic is not careful.
- Taking advantage of the application's degraded state or error conditions.

**Risk:**  
Increases the risk of asset hijacking, content spoofing, or inconsistent asset loading leading to exploitable UI or logic states.

**Recommendation:**  
- Maintain `missing_import_mode: strict` in production to ensure all required asset imports must exist.
- If using `warn`, implement thorough logging and monitoring so that missing assets are immediately detected and remediated.

---

### 3. No Input Validation on Paths

**Details:**  
The configuration does not demonstrate any form of input validation or sanitization for asset paths. If these values are ever influenced by user input or external sources, there is a risk of directory traversal attacks or inclusion of unauthorized files.

**Risk:**  
Potential access to files outside the intended asset directory.

**Recommendation:**  
- Always ensure that asset paths are hardcoded or securely validated.
- Apply strict normalization and validation checks to asset paths to prevent traversal or unauthorized access.

## Summary

While the provided YAML configuration is relatively limited in scope, several security concerns exist revolving around the exposure and management of assets:

- **Limit disclosure:** Make sure the `assets/` directory does not contain sensitive files.
- **Strict import enforcement:** Keep asset import mode strict in production to avoid inconsistencies or missing dependencies.
- **Path validation:** Always strictly validate asset paths to avoid traversal or arbitrary file access attacks.

**Attention should be paid to the broader context of how this configuration is used in the application to mitigate these vulnerabilities.**
