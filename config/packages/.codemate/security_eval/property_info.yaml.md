# Security Vulnerability Report

## Overview

The following code snippet in YAML appears to be configuration for a framework, specifically enabling something called `with_constructor_extractor` under `property_info`.

```yaml
framework:
    property_info:
        with_constructor_extractor: true
```

## Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Potential for Unauthorized Reflection or Constructor Extraction

#### Description
Setting `with_constructor_extractor: true` suggests that the framework will extract or introspect constructor information of classes and objects. If not properly controlled, this can expose internal implementation details, sensitive data, or allow attackers to instantiate objects in unexpected ways.

#### Risks
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Introspecting constructors may reveal parameter types, default values, or annotations that could contain sensitive information.
- **Insecure Object Instantiation:** If the framework allows dynamic creation of objects using reflected constructors, it could potentially instantiate objects with arbitrary arguments, leading to privilege escalation or logic bypass.
- **Insecure Deserialization:** Constructor extraction can be abused during (de)serialization operations, especially if the framework allows instantiating objects from untrusted input.

#### Examples
- If used in web applications, malicious users could craft requests that trigger the reflective instantiation of objects, possibly leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).
- Attackers could use knowledge of constructor parameters to guess object states or inject malicious code.

#### Mitigation
- Limit the exposure and use of `with_constructor_extractor` to trusted, internal components only.
- Implement strict access controls and input validation wherever reflective instantiation is possible.
- Regularly audit the classes and constructors exposed to the extractor.
- Ensure that only non-sensitive constructors are exposed.
- Consider disabling this feature if not needed.

**Note:**  
Without additional information about the specific framework or its use case, this assessment is based on common risks associated with reflection and dynamic code introspection.

## Recommendations

- **Review Documentation:** Understand what `with_constructor_extractor` does in your specific framework.
- **Access Control:** Restrict its use to secure, internal only contexts.
- **Least Privilege:** Expose the minimum required constructors.
- **Monitor Usage:** Implement logging and monitors for any suspicious constructor extraction or instantiation.
- **Patching & Updates:** Ensure the framework is kept up-to-date, as vulnerabilities in such features are commonly patched.

**Action Required:**  
Carefully assess the need for `with_constructor_extractor`. If not strictly required, disable it to reduce your attack surface. If necessary, apply the mitigations above to ensure secure usage.
