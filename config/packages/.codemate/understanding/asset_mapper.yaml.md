# High-Level Documentation of Asset Mapper Configuration

## Overview
This configuration file defines settings for an asset management system (likely part of a web application framework). It specifies how and where to load static assets (such as images, JavaScript, or CSS files) and how to handle missing assets during deployment.

## Key Components

### 1. Asset Mapper Configuration
- **Paths to Assets:**  
  - The `paths` property lists directories (`assets/`) that should be included and made available to the asset mapper.  
  - This allows the application to know where to find the static assets required for its operation.

- **Missing Import Mode:**  
  - The `missing_import_mode: strict` setting enforces that all asset imports must resolve correctly during development.  
  - If an asset is missing, an error will be raised, ensuring no broken links in the development environment.

### 2. Environment Specific Overrides

- **Production Environment (`when@prod`):**
  - For the production environment, the `missing_import_mode` is set to `warn` instead of `strict`.  
  - This means that if an asset is not found in production, a warning will be issued instead of throwing an error. This can help avoid interruptions in deployment due to missing assets, while still alerting developers to the issue.

## Summary Table

| Environment   | Asset Paths | Missing Import Mode | Effect              |
|---------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Default/Dev   | assets/     | strict              | Errors on missing   |
| Production    | assets/     | warn                | Warns on missing    |

## Purpose
- Ensures assets are properly managed and available to the application.
- Provides strict checking during development to catch issues early.
- Relaxes error handling in production to minimize disruptions while still providing warnings.

__This configuration demonstrates an environment-aware setup for asset management, promoting both development rigor and production resilience.__
