**High-Level Documentation**

---

**Purpose:**
This code configures a framework to enable a feature called `with_constructor_extractor` specifically for a component or module related to `property_info`.

---

**Key Elements:**

- **framework**: The top-level configuration section, likely representing settings for a software framework.
- **property_info**: A sub-section indicating this configuration is applied to a property information utility or module.
- **with_constructor_extractor: true**: Activates or enables a feature called "constructor extractor" within `property_info`.

---

**High-Level Behavior:**
With this configuration set, the framework will utilize or activate a mechanism to extract information from constructors (likely for properties in classes) within the context of `property_info`. This might be used for purposes such as automated reflection, property analysis, object mapping, or serialization support.

---

**Intended Usage:**
To instruct the framework to automatically gather information using constructors when handling or reflecting on property information. This is typically useful in frameworks that automate or streamline data manipulation tasks.
