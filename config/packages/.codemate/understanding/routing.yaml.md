# High-Level Documentation

This configuration sets up routing behavior for a web application framework (such as Symfony). It defines both general and environment-specific settings for how the router generates URLs and applies routing requirements.

**General Configuration**
- Establishes a section for router configuration.
- (Commented) Option to specify the default URI for generating URLs in non-HTTP contexts (for example, when running commands via the CLI).

**Production Environment Overrides**
- For the "prod" environment, the router's `strict_requirements` is set to `null`, which disables strict requirement checking (such as parameter pattern enforcement or missing parameters) to optimize for performance and avoid exceptions in production.

**Reference**
- Official documentation link provided for further details about routing and URL generation.

**Purpose**
- To ensure consistent and environment-appropriate routing behavior across development and production deployments.
