# Security Vulnerability Report

## File Reviewed

- A Symfony services configuration file (YAML) specifying service definitions for a PHP application.

## Overview

This configuration file defines services and injects environment variables for `App\Service\ErpNextService`. The `API_BASE`, `API_KEY`, and `API_SECRET` parameters are used as service constructor arguments. This review focuses **solely on security vulnerabilities** in these definitions.

## Identified Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Environment Variables for Secrets**

**Details:**
- The following sensitive secrets are injected using environment variables:
    - `%env(API_KEY)%`
    - `%env(API_SECRET)%`
- While using environment variables for secrets is a common practice, it can pose security risks if not handled carefully.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exposure Through Misconfiguration:**  
  Environment variables may be exposed unintentionally (e.g., through error messages, phpinfo(), or misconfigured deployment scripts).
- **Insufficient Secrets Management:**  
  Storing secrets in shell profile files, Dockerfiles, or version control by mistake (e.g., `.env`, `.env.local`) may leak sensitive data.
- **Accidental Logging:**  
  If these variables are logged at any stage (especially with verbose error logging), secrets could be captured in log files and accessed by unauthorized users.
- **No Secret Rotation Enforcement:**  
  The configuration does not indicate or enforce any secret management policies such as rotation, expiration, or access control.

**Recommendations:**
- Use robust secret management solutions (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), not just plain environment variables.
- Never commit `.env` files with secrets to version control.
- Configure production servers to prevent PHP info exposure and limit the attack surface.
- Restrict access to log files and ensure secrets are never logged.
- Document and regularly rotate secrets.

### 2. **No Service Access Restrictions**

**Details:**
- The configuration autowires and autoconfigures all classes in the `src/` directory as services.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Privilege Escalation or Service Injection:**  
  Autowiring every class grants service container access and may unintentionally expose sensitive internal classes, increasing attack surface and risk of privilege escalation.

**Recommendations:**
- Restrict the classes registered as services to only those necessary.
- Use explicit service definitions for classes that deal with secrets or sensitive operations.
- Apply proper access controls and limit service exposure.

### 3. **Potential Information Disclosure via Logs**

**Details:**
- The `App\Service\ErpNextService` receives a `logger` service as a dependency. 

**Vulnerability:**
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:**  
  If the service logs request details including the `API_KEY`, `API_SECRET`, or other sensitive info (intentionally or accidentally), logs may become a source of credential leakage.

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure code using the injected `logger` never logs secrets or sensitive info.
- Set up alerting or automated scans for secrets in production logs.

---

### 4. **No Input Validation Specified**

**Details:**
- The configuration does not show any input validation or sanitization for the environment-sourced variables.

**Vulnerability:**
- **Injection Attacks:**  
  If the environment variables (especially `API_BASE`) are externally supplied and not validated, they could be manipulated to inject malicious values (e.g., SSRF via `API_BASE`).

**Recommendations:**
- Validate and sanitize all configuration inputs, especially those coming from external sources.
- Implement whitelisting, input length checks, and data-type validation.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability                                   | Risk              | Recommendation                                                  |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insecure secret handling via environment        | High              | Use proper secret management, avoid logging, rotate secrets     |
| Too-broad service exposure via autowiring       | Moderate          | Restrict service registration, use explicit definitions         |
| Logging sensitive information                   | High              | Sanitize logs, audit logging practices, restrict log access     |
| Lack of input validation/sanitization           | Moderate-High     | Strictly validate all env-derived inputs                        |

## Final Notes

**While this YAML file doesn't contain secrets itself, the way it injects and manages secrets carries inherent risks if not handled correctly at each stage of development, deployment, and operation.**  
It is critical to combine good configuration practices with strong operational/opsec controls and code reviews to minimize these risks.
