# Code Review Report

## 1. **Configuration Context**

The code appears to be a YAML fragment for configuring route/resource loading in a Symfony (PHP) application security context, likely from `routes.yaml` or a similar file. 

---

## 2. **Critical Review**

### a) **Industry Standard Practices**

- **Recommended Indentation:**  
  Use 2 spaces for YAML indentation instead of 4 for consistency with best practices in Symfony documentation.

- **Key Naming:**  
  Leading underscore in route names (e.g., `_security_logout`) is typically reserved for Symfony internals and might lead to confusion or collisions. Prefer descriptive names without the underscore unless specifically needed.

### b) **Unoptimized Implementation**

- **Route Naming Convention:**  
  Use kebab-case or snake_case without leading underscore.  
  Document purpose with a comment.

### c) **Potential Errors**

- **Resource Reference:**  
  `security.route_loader.logout` should exist as a valid route loader or service. If not, this will cause a configuration error.

---

## 3. **Suggested Corrections (Pseudocode Only)**

```yaml
# Correct indentation, naming, and clarity
security_logout:
  resource: 'security.route_loader.logout'  # Make sure this resource exists
  type: service
```
or, if using kebab-case:

```yaml
security-logout:
  resource: 'security.route_loader.logout'
  type: service
```

---

## 4. **Summary of Issues**

- Replace leading underscore in route name with descriptive name for clarity and convention.
- Ensure correct indentation (2 spaces).
- Always validate the referenced resource or service exists.
- Add commenting for clarity and documentation purposes.
