**High-Level Documentation**

This code snippet defines a route configuration, likely from a Symfony (PHP framework) application’s routing YAML file. Here’s what it does at a high level:

- **Purpose:**  
  It configures a special route (named `_security_logout`) to handle the user logout functionality.

- **Resource:**  
  The route delegates its handling to a service called `security.route_loader.logout`, which is managed by Symfony’s security component.

- **Type:**  
  The `type: service` indicates that this route is provided by a service rather than pointing to a controller or a static path.

**Summary:**  
This configuration sets up the application’s logout route to be automatically handled by the Symfony security system, ensuring standardized logout behavior (clearing session, CSRF validation, redirect, etc.) without requiring manual controller code.
