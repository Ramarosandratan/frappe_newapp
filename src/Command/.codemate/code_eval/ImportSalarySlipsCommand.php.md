# Code Review Report

## General Observations

- The code is generally well-structured and uses dependency injection, exception handling, logging, and input validation.
- However, there are some design, efficiency, and correctness issues by industry standards.
- Several error handling, optimization, robustness, and clarifications are needed.

---

## 1. **Repeated File Parsing/Open Errors Not Handled**
- When reading CSVs (`Reader::createFromPath`), there is no catch for file not found or not readable, which could cause fatal errors.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
try {
    $csv = Reader::createFromPath($filePath, 'r');
} catch (\Throwable $e) {
    throw new \RuntimeException("Cannot open file: $filePath");
}
```

---

## 2. **Sleep Usage in ensureCompanyExists**
- `sleep(2);` is used after company creation. This blocks the process and is not an optimal or reliable way to ensure availability.
- In production, this should be replaced by specific recheck or retry with backoff and max attempts.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
$attempts = 0;
while (!$this->erpNextService->getCompany($companyName) && $attempts < 5) {
    usleep(500000); // sleep for 0.5 seconds
    $attempts++;
}
if (!$this->erpNextService->getCompany($companyName)) {
    throw new \RuntimeException("Company '$companyName' not available after creation.");
}
```

---

## 3. **Improper Gender Mapping**
- In `importEmployees`, gender is mapped as `'Male'` or `'Female'` based only on `'Masculin'`, which may miss other or mistyped values.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
switch (strtolower(trim($record['genre']))) {
    case 'masculin':
        $gender = 'Male';
        break;
    case 'fÃ©minin':
    case 'feminin':
        $gender = 'Female';
        break;
    default:
        $gender = 'Other';
}
'gender' => $gender,
```

---

## 4. **Array Key Existence Not Checked Before Access**
- When mapping employee refs (`$employeeMap[$record['Ref']] = ...`), no check is performed if `employeeMap` already contains the key (could duplicate and overwrite).

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
if (isset($employeeMap[$record['Ref']])) {
    $io->warning("Employee Ref '{$record['Ref']}' already exists. Skipping duplicate.");
    continue;
}
```

---

## 5. **Unvalidated Components in Salary Structure**
- In `importSalaryStructures`, typing for 'type' field assumes only 'earning' or otherwise (deduction), which could slip in invalid types.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
$type = strtolower($component['type']);
if (!in_array($type, ['earning', 'deduction'])) {
    $io->warning("Invalid type '{$component['type']}' for component '{$component['name']}'. Skipping.");
    continue;
}
```

---

## 6. **DateTime Creation Without Error Check**
- In `importSalaryData`, `$startDate` is created from a format, but no check if parsing succeeded.
- If input is invalid, code throws fatal error in later calls.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
$startDate = \DateTime::createFromFormat('d/m/Y', $record['Mois']);
if (!$startDate) {
    throw new \InvalidArgumentException("Invalid date format: {$record['Mois']}");
}
```

---

## 7. **parseSalaryAmount: Locale-Unsafe Replacement**
- Replacing both spaces and commas with a dot can result in unintended decimals in locales that use ',' as decimal separator and '.' as thousand separator.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
$cleaned = str_replace([' ', "\u{00A0}"], '', $amount); // Remove spaces and non-breaking spaces
$cleaned = str_replace(',', '.', $cleaned); // Replace comma with dot (if comma is decimal in locale)
if (!is_numeric($cleaned)) ...
```
*Also, ensure handling only if there is at most one dot in the result.*

---

## 8. **Class method visibility**
- All class methods are `private`, which is fine unless needed for extension; if planned for inheritance, use `protected`.

---

## 9. **Danger of Partial Imports**
- If one record fails, the loop continues, but client may want summary (e.g., number of errors). Currently only successes are counted.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
$failCount = 0;
foreach (...) {
    try {
        ...
    } catch (...) {
        $failCount++;
        ...
    }
}
if ($failCount > 0) {
    $io->warning("$failCount records failed to import.");
}
```

---

## 10. **Logging Exceptions**
- Log exception objects to get stack traces, not only messages.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
$this->logger->error('...', ['exception' => $e]);
```

---

## 11. **Returning Early on Non-Critical Error**
- In some methods, fatal errors (e.g., company creation fails) throw exceptions, but other non-critical data issues merely warn. Make sure the strategy is properly discussed for the business requirement (all-or-nothing vs best-effort).

---

## 12. **Code Readability/Formatting**
- Use consistent spacing and line breaks for better readability.
- Avoid deep nesting where possible.

---

## 13. **Strict Type Declarations**
- Add `declare(strict_types=1);` at the top of the PHP file to enforce strict types.

### **Suggested Correction**
```php
declare(strict_types=1);
```

## **Summary Table**

| Issue | Place In Code | Industry Standard Correction |
|-------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| File open fail not caught | All import methods | Use `try-catch` for file open  |
| Sleep for company readiness | ensureCompanyExists | Poll/check with backoff instead of `sleep` |
| Gender field mapping | importEmployees | Robust switch/case or validation |
| Duplicate employee refs | importEmployees | Check with `isset` before insert |
| Salary component type | importSalaryStructures | Validate allowed types, skip invalid |
| Date parsing in salary data | importSalaryData | Check result of `createFromFormat` |
| Salary amount localization | parseSalaryAmount | Better cleaning and validation |
| Error/exception logging | All | Log exception object, use context |
| Fail counter for imports | All import methods | Keep `$failCount` and warn of errors |
| Strict types enforcement | Top of file | Add `declare(strict_types=1);` |
