# Security Vulnerability Report

This report analyzes the provided Twig template code for **security vulnerabilities**. Specifically, it focuses on risks such as XSS (Cross Site Scripting), URL injection, and data exposure stemming from template rendering and the use of dynamic variables.

## 1. Output Escaping (XSS Vulnerability)

### Issue
Twig automatically escapes variables by default if the template is configured accordingly. However, if **auto-escaping** is **disabled**, or if any output is marked as "raw" elsewhere in the project, the following dynamic outputs are **potentially vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS)**:

- `{{ employee.employee_name }}`
- `{{ employee.name }}`
- `{{ employee.date_of_joining|date('Y-m-d') }}`
- `{{ employee.company }}`
- `{{ employee.gender }}`
- `{{ slip.start_date|date('F Y') }}`
- `{{ slip.gross_pay|number_format(2, '.', ',') }}`
- `{{ slip.net_pay|number_format(2, '.', ',') }}`

**If auto-escaping is disabled or bypassed, malicious input can result in XSS.**

### Evidence

```twig
<h1>{{ employee.employee_name }}</h1>
<p><strong>Employee Number:</strong> {{ employee.name }}</p>
<a href="/payslip/{{ slip.name }}" class="btn btn-sm btn-info">View Payslip</a>
```

If, for example, `employee.employee_name` contains a script, this would yield a classic XSS attack vector.

### Recommendation

- Ensure Twigâ€™s auto-escaping feature is **enabled and not bypassed** anywhere (globally or in sub-templates).
- Never use the `|raw` filter unless output is known to be 100% safe.
- If any untrusted input is rendered, consider explicitly escaping:
  ```twig
  {{ employee.employee_name|e }}
  ```

## 2. Unfiltered Data in URL Paths

### Issue
The code constructs URLs by interpolating unfiltered data from the `slip.name` property:

```twig
<a href="/payslip/{{ slip.name }}" class="btn btn-sm btn-info">View Payslip</a>
```

If `slip.name` is user-controlled or not sanitized, it can enable:
- **URL injection** (Injection of malicious URLs)
- **Path traversal attacks** (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`)
- **XSS** (if browser interprets malicious data in `href`)

### Recommendation

- Sanitize and validate all route parameters.
- Use URL filters (such as `url_encode`):
  ```twig
  <a href="/payslip/{{ slip.name|url_encode }}" class="btn btn-sm btn-info">View Payslip</a>
  ```
- Consider using named routes (e.g., `path('some_route', {'name': slip.name})`) to let the framework handle proper URL generation and escaping.

## 3. Information Disclosure

### Issue
Sensitive information such as employee names, numbers, companies, dates of joining, and salary data is rendered by the template.

### Risks

- If user authorization is not **strictly enforced** by the controller/backend (not visible in the template), **unauthorized users** may access sensitive data.
- URLs like `/payslip/{{ slip.name }}` may enable insecure direct object references (IDOR) if not properly checked for user ownership/authorization.

### Recommendation

- Ensure **access control** is enforced at the controller or before rendering to the template.
- Never expose identifiers that could be guessed/sequenced for sensitive objects.

---

## 4. Direct Output of Identifiers

### Issue
The template directly outputs identifiers such as `employee.name` and `slip.name` without obfuscation or validation. If these are sequential or guessable, they may facilitate enumeration or IDOR risks.

### Recommendation

- Use UUIDs or secure, non-sequential identifiers for sensitive records.
- Validate ownership and permissions on any object referenced from the frontend.

## Summary Table

| Risk                        | Location/Variable                 | Mitigation                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| XSS (Auto-Escaping assumed) | All `{{ }}` output                | Ensure auto-escaping is enabled            |
| URL Injection/Traversal     | `<a href="/payslip/{{ slip.name }}` | `|url_encode`, use route path helpers      |
| Information Disclosure      | All employee/salary outputs       | Backend access control required            |
| IDOR                        | `employee.name`, `slip.name` in href | Use secure IDs and validate permissions    |

---

## Conclusion

The primary vulnerabilities are **XSS (if output escaping is not enforced)** and **IDOR/URL injection** through direct inclusion of untrusted variables in URLs and HTML. Proper escape functions, URL encoding, and access controls must be in place to mitigate these vulnerabilities. ALWAYS validate input and ensure robust server-side access control to protect sensitive data.
