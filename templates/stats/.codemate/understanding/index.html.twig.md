## Key Features and Structure

### 1. **Page Inheritance and Title**
- The template extends a base layout (`base.html.twig`).
- Sets the page title as "Statistiques des Salaires".

### 2. **Main Content Block (`body`)**
- Displays a header: **"Statistiques des Salaires"**.

### 3. **Year Filter Form**
- Contains a dropdown list populated with available years (from `years` variable).
- Submits the form upon selection or via a filter button.
- The filtering action reloads the page with data for the selected year.

### 4. **Statistical Chart**
- If a `chart` variable is provided, renders an interactive chart displaying salary statistics for the selected year, using a predefined function `render_chart`.

### 5. **Monthly Salary Statistics Table**
- A responsive table presents months as rows and salary breakdown as columns:
    - **Mois (Month)**
    - **Salary Components:** Dynamically generated from `allComponents` (e.g., base salary, bonuses, etc.).
    - **Total Brut** (Total Gross)
    - **Total DÃ©ductions** (Total Deductions)
    - **Total Net** (Total Net Pay)
- Each cell is properly formatted for currency (French notation: comma as decimal separator, space as thousands separator).
- If no data exists for the selected year, it displays a corresponding message in the table.
