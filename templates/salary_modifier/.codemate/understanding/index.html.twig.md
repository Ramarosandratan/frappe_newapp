# High-Level Documentation

## Template Purpose

This template renders a user interface for **bulk modifying salary components** in existing payroll records based on specific criteria. It is built using Twig (for Symfony/PHP projects) and extends a base layout.

---

## Major Functionalities

### 1. **Page Title and Heading**
- Displays the title **"Modification des éléments de salaire"** both in the page's `<title>` and as an H1 heading.

### 2. **Form for Bulk Modification Criteria**
- Presents a form that lets the user specify:
  - **Which salary component** to modify (dropdown, dynamically populated).
  - **Modification condition** to check against the existing value (dropdown, e.g., equals, less than).
  - **Condition value** (numeric input).
  - **New value** to set, if the condition matches (numeric input).
  - **Start and end dates** to delimit the payroll period affected (date inputs).
- All fields are required and use standard HTML form controls.

### 3. **Informational Help Section**
- A styled help block explaining:
  - The steps and logic of mass update (how the tool operates).
  - Descriptions for each input field and what users should enter.

## Dynamic Data Used

- `salaryComponents`: List of available salary components (e.g., Base Salary, Allowance, Social Tax) used to populate a select dropdown.
- `conditions`: Key-value pairs of possible conditional operations (e.g., "greater than", "equal to") to choose the modification criteria.

---

## UI/UX

- Uses Bootstrap classes for layout, styling, and responsiveness.
- Form is split into logical sections with labels and clear separation.
- Submit button initiates the actual update (on POST).
- Explanations ensure users understand the impact and usage.

---

## Intended Audience

- Payroll or HR administrators needing to perform controlled mass updates of payroll components across multiple employees’ pay records.

## Summary

This template serves as a **safe and guided UI for advanced payroll operations**, ensuring users can target and update salary data accurately and in bulk, with in-form explanations to prevent errors.
